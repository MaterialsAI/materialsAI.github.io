speaker_school: "Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory"
speaker_bio: "James Chapman is a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the Materials Dynamics and Kinetics Group. He completed his PhD at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Materials Science and Engineering, and completed a double bachelors in Math and Physics at MCLA. His current research focuses around the characterization of disordered materials and their connection to ion transport. By combining the strengths of the tools available throughout the data science and physics-based simulations domains, he hopes to accelerate our understanding of how disordered material phases affect the underlying properties of the material under a variety of external conditions."
