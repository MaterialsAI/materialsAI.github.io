speaker_school: "University of Missouri"
speaker_bio: "Tommy Sewell is a Professor in the Department of Chemistry with an adjunct appointment as Professor in MAE. Prior to moving to MU 13 years ago to pursue an academic career, Sewell was a technical staff member in the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory for nearly 15 years. He has over 100 journal publications in the areas of materials theory & simulation and fundamental theoretical chemical dynamics. Sewell was named APS Fellow in 2017 for his sustained contributions to the field of shock compression of condensed matter. He is PI for an active DoD/AFOSR MURI project, Integrating multiscale modeling and experiments to develop a meso-informed predictive capability for explosives safety and performance (federal award number FA9550-19-1-0318). At MU, Sewell has served as PI or Co-PI on funded federal research grants from AFOSR, ARO, DTRA, NNSA, and ONR. Recent graduate student/postdoctoral outcomes from Sewellâ€™s group at MU include research appointments at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NIH, and the U.S. Army Research Laboratory; tenure-track faculty positions in MAE at Ole Miss and Chemistry at Ferris State University; and permanent positions in scientific software development and industry."
