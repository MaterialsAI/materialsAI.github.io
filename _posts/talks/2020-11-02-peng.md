abstract: "Batteries are ubiquitous in our daily life, so are the potential safety risks, as already witnessed by the fast development of portable electronic devices and electric cars. Designing safe batteries has been very challenging as the spatiotemporal heterogeneities already discovered in experimental systems have not been translated into rigorous mathematical formulas for practical implementation. In this seminar, we will see how the total current applied to the battery electrodes, both the phase-forming lithium metal anode and phase-transforming intercalation porous electrode, will inevitably get localized to surpass the safety limit by several orders of magnitude. The extreme local electrochemical dynamics, under the disguise of the safe total current, are responsible for the unexpected failures of batteries. While continuum-level mathematical models we developed can accurately explain the evolution of these heterogeneities, new methods of artificial intelligence may eventually help identify the fundamental reasons and multiscale characteristics of their initiation at the interface exchanging energy and materials."
