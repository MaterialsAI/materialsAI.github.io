title:  "Towards Automated and Efficient Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS)"
speaker_name: "Yan Feng" 
speaker_url: "http://www.cse.unr.edu/~fyan/index.html"
speaker_school: "University of Nevada, Reno"
speaker_bio: "Feng Yan is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering
              Department at University of Nevada, Reno (UNR). He is the director of the Intelligent
              Data and Systems Lab (IDS Lab) at UNR. Dr. Yan received both the M.S. degree and
              Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the College of William and Mary, and worked
              at Microsoft Research and HP Labs. Dr. Yanâ€™s recent research focus includes machine
              learning, cloud/edge/high performance computing, storage, as well as cross-
              disciplinary topics such as big data driven wildfire forecasting, AI strengthened
              material science and engineering. Dr. Yan and his team are actively publishing at the
              most prestigious venues in machine learning area (e.g., NIPS, KDD, AAAI, etc.) and
              computer system area (e.g., USENIX ATC, SC, HPDC, FAST, EuroSys, etc.). Dr. Yan and
              his students are recipients of the Best Student Paper Award of IEEE CLOUD 2018 and
              the Best Paper Award of CLOUD 2019. Dr. Yan serves as Social Media Chair of ACM
              SIGMETRICS."

abstract: "Driven by the sustained advances of Machine Learning (ML) and fast evolving of
           cloud computing, the past a few years have witnessed a surging demand of Machine
           Learning as a Service (MLaaS). MLaaS is widely supported by the leading cloud
           platforms to facilitate ML model design, model training, and model inference serving
           in an automated and scalable manner. In this talk, Dr. Yan will present the recent
           progress from his team on MLaaS, including improve automated ML model design
           with topology-aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS); develop an efficient training
           job deployment framework driven by a novel cost-ware Bayesian optimization
           approach; and tackle the dual challenges of Service Level Objective (SLO) compliance
           and cost effectiveness in inference model serving by designing a scalable and
           adaptive serving system. Dr. Yan will also introduce how these MLaaS techniques
           help wildfire smoke forecasting in a cross-discretionary NSF BIGDATA project led by
           Dr. Yan."
