<p>How long does it take to call your emergency contacts when you need immediate help? 
In many cases, every single second matters. Our goal in this project is to create a smart alarm system 
in the form of a wristband, that allows you to trigger an alarm by simply stretching it. 
The device is made energy-free through the integration of a solar panel and a rechargeable battery.</p>

<p>This project is <strong>in progress</strong>.</p>
