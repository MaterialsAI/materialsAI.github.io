<p>See the <a href="/_teaching/productdesign/PreferenceLearning.pptx">lecture notes</a>, the <a href="http://designinformaticslab.github.io/productdesign_tutorial/2017/02/06/qualtrics_tutorial.html">Qualtrics tutorial</a>, and this engineer-friendly tutorial 
(<a href="/_teaching/productdesign/Discrete Choice Conjoint - Part 1.pdf">Part 1</a>, <a href="/_teaching/productdesign/Discrete Choice Conjoint - Part 2.pdf">Part 2</a>) on discrete choice analysis.</p>

<h2 id="activity-1-test-the-survey">Activity 1: Test the survey</h2>
<p>Please participate in a mock <a href="https://asu.co1.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_eevvPb4p2ZfSFpP">survey</a> regarding your preference on cars. Once we collect the data,
we will go through a data analysis procedure called <strong>discrete choice analysis</strong>, from where
quantified preference on attribute levels can be revealed for the participant group as a whole and
for individual participants.</p>

<h2 id="homework-2-conduct-a-market-survey-and-report-your-analysis-results">Homework 2: Conduct a market survey and report your analysis results</h2>

<p>The report should contain the following elements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A description of your survey goal, i.e., what do you want to learn from your consumer group? This
could include qualitative goals, and quantitative hypotheses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A description of design attributes and attribute levels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A complete sample survey and a discussion on how questions are designed</p>
  </li>
  <li>A description of how data is collected
    <ul>
      <li>Who do you collect data from?</li>
      <li>When is the data collected?</li>
      <li>Are your collected data valid? How do you validate?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A description of how the data is analyzed
    <ul>
      <li>What preprocess steps are necessary for your data?</li>
      <li>For discrete choice analysis, how do you set up your model and what assumptions do you use?</li>
      <li>What results do you get from your analysis?</li>
      <li>What insights do you get from your analysis?</li>
      <li>From these insights, how will you improve your survey?</li>
      <li><strong>Please provide a visualization of your results</strong>. Simply pasting MATLAB tables to your report will not be accepted.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The code and raw data you used for the analysis
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure that by directly running your code with your data, others can reproduce your results.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Submit your report to yiren@asu.edu with the exact title “MAE540 Homework 2 - Team number”. 
Please make sure it is in <strong>pdf</strong> format.</li>
</ul>
