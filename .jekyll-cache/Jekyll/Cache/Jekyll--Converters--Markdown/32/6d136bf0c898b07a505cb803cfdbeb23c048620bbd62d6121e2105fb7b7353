<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p><img src="/_teaching/designopt/polebalancing/animation.gif" alt="Drawing" style="height: 400px;" /></p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to use OpenAI gym to create a 
controller for the classic pole balancing problem, and test what you learned
on a rocket landing problem. Both will be solved using Reinforcement Learning.
While fully understanding RL would require background knowledge beyond
what we have covered in this class (namely, Markov Decision Process, Dynamic Programming,
and Policy Search), here we present one particular formulation of an
 optimization problem for designing a controller, and show that
 gradient descent can be applied to solve this problem.</p>

<p>It should be noted that a controller for pole balancing
can be designed and analyzed through classic control theory, by linearizing
its dynamics. The presented solution here does not require knowledge about the
dynamical system, nor does it require linearization (is it good news or not?).</p>

<h3 id="get-ready">Get Ready</h3>

<p>This section discusses the preparation you need to kick start the project.
We will start with a minimalistic guideline, and then introduce all gadgets
involved (Git, Github, Python, and TensorFlow) for those who are interested.</p>

<h4 id="a-minimalistic-guideline-to-get-things-to-work-without-docker">A minimalistic guideline to get things to work (without Docker)</h4>

<p>This guideline is written for Windows users and tested on Windows only.
For Linux and Mac users, you can follow the guideline, although you should
already have Python and Git installed by default.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To download the cartpole sample <a href="https://github.com/hope-yao/cartpole">code</a>,
you can either click on the green button (Clone or download) to download 
as a zip, or use <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>(See intro to Git).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/">Python 3.5</a>.
Check if Python is correctly installed by typing in the command line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python</code>.
To do so, launch the
command prompt (go to start and search <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmd</code>).
<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: When you install Python, please choose to
install <strong>pip</strong>, and choose to <strong>include Python in your environment path</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Install TensorFlow (CPU version) <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/">here</a> if
you are on Linux or Mac, or <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows">here</a>
if you are on Windows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once done, go to the folder where you hold this code, type in the command line: <br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
pip install -r requirement.txt
</code>. 
This should install all dependencies.
<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Please run this command in the <em>command line</em>, rather than in the <em>Python prompt</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can then run the code by typing in:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
python main.py
</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="a-little-more-details-on-the-gadgets-involved">A little more details on the gadgets involved</h4>

<p>The following would be useful if you plan to build your course project using
Python, TensorFlow, or Github.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Development Environment</strong>: I recommend <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download">Pycharm</a>.
This is an environment where you can manage all Python versions, packages, and version control,
which I will explain next. <strong>NOTE</strong>: As a student, you can get a free license for Pycharm.
<!--For **Linux** users, you can install prerequisits using the commands below:-->
<!--```-->
<!--$pip install jupyter-->
<!--$pip install tensorflow-->
<!--$pip install gym-->
<!--```--></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Version control</strong>: The idea of version control is to keep track of all changes
you make throughout the project so that you can always trace back to
an earlier version of your project. It also make collaboration more seamless,
e.g., by automatically merging together different versions of the same
document produced by members of a team. <strong>Git</strong> is arguably the most popular
version control package out there right now. Once you install git, you can ask it to track
any document you work on, e.g., texts, codes, etc. Here we use git to both <em>clone</em>
an existing project from github, and to version control that cloned project locally.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Github</strong>: Github is the place where your store your project for free, as long as
the project is made publicly available. It is becoming a standard in academia and some industry that
codes and data be published on github so that results claimed by researchers can be reproduced.
In this class, you are required to publish your project on github so that your models
can be reused by future students (depending on your choice of
the <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">license</a>), and your
results can be reproduced if necessary.</p>

<h3 id="pole-balancing">Pole balancing</h3>

<p>If you successfully get the example code to run, and wonder what happened
under the hood, please read on.</p>

<h4 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h4>

<p>The simple pole balancing (inverse pendulum) setting consists of a pole
and a cart. The system states are the cart displacement \(x\), 
cart velocity \(\dot{x}\), pole angle \(\theta\), and pole angular velocity 
\(\dot{\theta}\). The parameters of the default system is as follows:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Left-aligned</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Center-aligned</th>

    </tr>

      <td style="text-align: center">10.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">delta_t</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">0.02</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">theta_threshold</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">12 (degrees)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">delta_t</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">2.4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<!--The system equations are ***.-->

<p>The controller takes in the system states, and outputs a fixed force on the cart
to either left or right. The controller needs to be designed so that within
4 seconds, the pole angle does not exceed 12 degrees, and the cart displacement
does not exceed 2.4 unit length. A trial will be terminated if the system 
is balanced for more than 4 seconds, or any of the constraints are violated. 
<!--The **objective** of the control algorithm is to make system to stay in a given region of state space as long as posible. Default physical parameters of this problem are:--></p>

<h4 id="some-preliminaries-for-reinforcement-learning">Some preliminaries for reinforcement learning</h4>

<p>We first introduce
the concept of a <strong>Markov Decision Process</strong>: An MDP contains a <em>state space</em>,
an <em>action space</em>, a <em>transition function</em>, a <em>reward function</em>, and 
a decay parameter \(\gamma\). In our case,
the state space contains all possible combinations of \(x\), \(\dot{x}\), 
\(\theta\), \(\dot{\theta}\). The action space contains the force to the left, 
and the force to the right. The transition function \(s_{k+1} = T(s_k,a_k)\)
computes the next state \(s_{k+1}\) based on the current state \(s_k\) and 
the action \(a_k\).</p>

<p>The transition is given by the system equations.
The reward function defines an instantaneous reward \(r_k = r(s_k)\).
In particular, we define reward as 1 when the system does not fail, or 0
otherwise. A discount factor \(\gamma\) is applied to rewards so that
rewards in the far future worth less than the near future. A long term
<em>value</em> function is defined recursively as a function of the controller \(\pi\):</p>

\[V_k(\pi,s_k) = r_k +
\gamma V_{k+1}(\pi,T(s_k,a_k)).\]

<p>We define the
controller as a function of the states that outputs a number
between 0 and 1: \(\pi(s,w) \in [0,1]\), where \(w\) is the unknown
parameters to be learned.
This number will be treated as the probability for choosing the action
‚Äúpushing to the left‚Äù. The probability for ‚Äúpushing to the right‚Äù will
be \(1-\pi(s,w)\).</p>

<p>Due to the randomness in the initial state \(s_0\) and the sequence of
actions \(a_0\), \(a_1\),‚Ä¶, \(a_K\), the value function
\(V_0(\pi,s_0)\) is a random variable parameterized by \(w\).</p>

<p>The goal of optimal control is to find optimal controller
parameters \(w\) that maximizes
the expectation of the value</p>

\[\mathbb{E}_{s_0,a_0,a_1,...,a_K}[V_0(\pi,s_0)].\]

<h4 id="a-simple-loss-function">A simple loss function</h4>

<p>Given a trial run with \(K\) time steps
based on the current controller, we collect the instantaneous 
rewards \(r_k\), actions \(a_k\), and the controller outputs \(\pi_k\) for \(k=1,...,K\). 
We can minimize the following loss function</p>

<p>\(f(w) = -\sum_{k=1}^K (\sum_{j=k}^K \gamma^{j-k}r_j) (a_k\log(\pi_k)+(1-a_k)\log(1-\pi_k))\).</p>

<p>In this loss function, the first term \(\sum_{j=k}^K \gamma^{j-k}r_j\) represents
the value at time step \(k\), the second term \(a_k\log(\pi_k)+(1-a_k)\log(1-\pi_k)\) is close to
\(0\) when the favored action is chosen, and \(-\inf\) when the unfavored action is chosen.
Essentially, the loss is minimized when all chosen control decisions \(a_k\) lead
to high value. Thus by tuning \(w\), we correct the mistakes we made in the 
trial (i.e., high value from unfavored move, or low value from favored move).</p>

<p>In the code, you may notice that the values are normalized.
According to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07714">this paper</a>, this treatment
speeds up the training process.</p>

<h4 id="controller-model">Controller model</h4>

<p>We mentioned that the controller computes a probability \(\pi(s,w)\). But
how does this function look like? Here we model \(\pi(s,w)\)
as a single-layer neural network:</p>

<p><img src="/_teaching/designopt/polebalancing/cart-pole-controller.png" alt="Drawing" style="height: 400px;" /></p>

<p>It is found that a single layer is sufficient for this environment setting.
In fact, adding layers may deteriorate the training performance due to the
additional network complexity.</p>

<!--Stochastic gradient descent with momentum is used to train this network:-->
<!--![SGD](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4895d44c0572fb2988f2f335c28cc055a7f75fa0)-->
<!--You can play with its paramters by using your own inputs to main.py.-->

<h4 id="training-algorithm">Training algorithm</h4>

<p>Due to the probabilistic nature of the controller, we minimize an averaged
loss \(\bar{f}(w) = \sum_{t=1}^T f_t(w)\) over \(T\) trials. This is done by simply
running the simulation \(T\) times, recording all data, and calculate the gradient
of \(\bar{f}(w)\). Notice that the gradient in this case will be stochastic, in the sense that
we only use \(T\) random samples to approximate it, rather than finding the theoretical
mean of \(\nabla_w \bar{f}\).
We use [ADAM][adam] to perform stochastic gradient descent.</p>

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>

<p>With default problem settings, we can get a convergence curve similar this:</p>

<p><img src="/_teaching/designopt/polebalancing/iteration.png" alt="Drawing" style="height: 400px;" /></p>

<p>Y axis of the main plot is the total reward a policy achieves,
X axis is the number of training epochs. 
The small window shows the normalized trajectory of cart positions and 
pole angles in the most recent trial. It can be seen that the learning
achieves a good controller in the end.</p>

<h3 id="rocket-landing">Rocket landing</h3>

<p>The rocket landing case is created by my former student
<a href="https://github.com/sjellio1/MAE598_Project">Steven Elliott</a>. The report
is <a href="https://github.com/sjellio1/MAE598_Project/blob/master/Writeup.pdf">here</a>.
Below is a brief introduction to his code.</p>

<h4 id="problem-statement-1">Problem statement</h4>

<p>The rocket has 6 states: the x and y coordinates, the angle, and the time
derivative of these three. The action space is discrete:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Action 0 - No thrust, no torque</li>
  <li>Action 1 - No thrust, torque left</li>
  <li>Action 2 - No thrust, torque right</li>
  <li>Action 3 - Trust, no torque</li>
  <li>Action 4 - Thrust, torque left</li>
  <li>Action 5 - Thrust, torque right</li>
</ul>

<p>The reward is defined as the negative of the Euclidean distance from the
last position of the rocket to the target landing location.</p>

<h4 id="exercise">Exercise</h4>

<p>Please test the <a href="https://github.com/sjellio1/MAE598_Project">code</a> and think
about the following questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What do you think is a good objective function to use for the training?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How will you formulate the problem if the dynamics of the rocket is known?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
