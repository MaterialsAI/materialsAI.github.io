<h1 id="marketing---qualtrics-and-discrete-choice-analysis-dca-tutorial">Marketing - Qualtrics and Discrete Choice Analysis (DCA) Tutorial</h1>
<p>by Max Yi Ren</p>

<p>I wrote this tutorial under the situation that (1) ASU only support Qualtrics as its survey provider 
and (2) at the moment of writing, Qualtrics does not have discrete choice functionalities. Please
check other software/service that provide such functionalities before you choose this option.</p>

<p>The tutorial will have two parts: We first introduce a script that automatically generates
a Qualtrics survey (only the DCA portion) for given attributes and attribute levels. We then
introduce an analysis script based on Dr. <a href="http://eml.berkeley.edu//~train/">Kenneth Train</a>‚Äôs mixed logit code (requires MATLAB), 
that outputs the part-worth distributions of the attributes (for linear terms) and levels (for nonlinear terms).</p>

<p>All codes used in this tutorial can be <strong>downloaded <a href="/_teaching/productdesign/discrete_choice_analysis.zip">here</a></strong>.</p>

<h2 id="product-attributes-levels-and-part-worths">Product Attributes, Levels, and Part-worths</h2>
<p><strong>Attributes</strong> are properties of the product that directly affect the purchase decision of consumers, 
e.g., price, MPG, acceleration, safety for a car. Note that in conventional marketing research, attributes
are only restricted to quantifiable properties. My recent research in preference learning
has extended to ‚Äúcomplex attributes‚Äù that are not directly quantifiable, e.g., aesthetics. 
See <a href="http://designinformaticslab.github.io/project-crowdsourcing/2016/05/29/carmax.html">this</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Levels</strong> of an attribute could be continuous, discrete, or categorical, e.g., price levels are 
continuous in nature, safety ratings are discrete (ordinal), while engine type (hybrid or gasoline)
is categorical.</p>

<p><strong>Part-worths</strong> represent the sensitivity of one‚Äôs preference to each attribute level. This is under
the assumption that the preference ($u$) is a linear function of all levels: 
\(u({\bf x}) = \beta_{11} x_{11} + \beta_{21} x_{21} + \cdots\),
where $\beta_{ij}$ is the part-worth for the $j$th level of the $i$th attribute.</p>

<p>Note that the above formulation assigns each level an individual part-worth, thus it models the nonlinear
preference for each attribute. This is not always necessary if we know that a linear trend exists for certain attributes.
For example, if we assume that people get happier linearly along lowered price, then we can use
$\beta_{\text{price}}\text{Price}$.</p>

<h2 id="survey-creation">Survey creation</h2>

<h3 id="generation-of-a-dca-survey">Generation of a DCA survey</h3>
<p>We will use ‚Äúgenerate_survey.m‚Äù here. This script allows you can set up the attributes and levels that you believe your consumer group cares about.
To do so, simply modify the <em>attributes</em> and <em>levels</em> variables in the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Enter survey settings %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
attributes = ***;
levels = ***;
number_questions = 10; % MAE540: Do not change
number_alternatives = 2; % MAE540: Do not change
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Enter survey settings %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The number of questions and the number of alternatives are fixed, i.e., you will have a survey
with 10 pairwise comparison questions. Note that the survey won‚Äôt work properly if you add new pairwise
comparison blocks by copying from these existing ones in Qualtrics.</p>

<h3 id="testing-the-survey">Testing the survey</h3>
<p>Once you set up the survey, and before you launch it, please preview the survey to make sure it 
flows well and is free of bugs. To do so, simply click the <strong>Preview Survey</strong> button.</p>

<h3 id="launch-the-survey">Launch the survey</h3>
<p>Once the survey is all set, you can launch it by email or through an anonymous link. You can find 
these choices under the <strong>Distributions</strong> tab.</p>

<h3 id="download-the-data">Download the data</h3>
<p>You can download the currently stored data any time during the launch. To do so, go to the ‚ÄúData &amp; Analysis‚Äù
tab and choose <strong>Export &amp; Import-&gt;Export Data-&gt;Export Data with Legacy Format</strong>. Note that choosing ‚ÄúDownload Data Table‚Äù
will also work but the resulting csv file will have a slightly different format and you will need to modify the analysis code
to accommodate this.</p>

<h2 id="data-analysis">Data analysis</h2>

<h3 id="preprocess-the-data">Preprocess the data</h3>
<p>The first thing we need to do is to remove all unnecessary information from the downloaded csv file. 
Once done, your file should have rows that look like the following:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>choice to question 1 (this should be either 1 or 2)</td>
      <td>product1_attribute1_level</td>
      <td>product1_attribute2_level</td>
      <td>‚Ä¶</td>
      <td>product2_attribute1_level</td>
      <td>‚Ä¶</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>To explain,</p>

<ul>
  <li>each row contains the choices of one participant</li>
  <li>each row has 10 sections corresponding to 10 questions</li>
  <li>in each section, the first column is either 1 or 2, indicating the chosen product in that pair</li>
  <li>the rest of the columns in a section represent the attribute level configurations of the two products. Product 1 goes first.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="specify-the-preference-model">Specify the preference model</h3>
<p>We will use ‚Äúanalysis.m‚Äù for setting up the model and conducting analysis.</p>

<p>First, make sure that the attributes and levels in this code are set to be 
consistent with the survey.</p>

<p>Now we need to look at how many part-worths to include in the 
preference (or called <em>utility</em>) model. In the worst case,
one would need to assign part-worths to every attribute level, 
if every attribute contributes nonlinearly
to the preference. However, using a lot of attributes and/or levels 
while the number of participants is small could lead to a model with high uncertainty. 
The rule of thumb is to avoid having more part-worths than the amount of pairwise 
choice responses you collected. In the case of a small amount of responses,
we would try to simplify the preference model. 
For example, as mentioned above, it is often reasonable to consider that price 
has a linear (and negative)
impact on human choice making, i.e., more expensive products 
attract less people, given all other attributes the same.
Thus we only need one part-worth for price to model consumers‚Äô sensitivity to price.</p>

<p>The preference model can be set up by the following lines in the code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>x = [x(:,1:5)*[15000,25000,35000,45000,55000]'/10000,x(:,6:8),...
    x(:,9:13)*[20,30,40,50,60]'/10,x(:,14:16),x(:,17:21)*[2,4,6,8,10]',...
    x(:,22:24),x(:,25:end)*[100,200,300,400]'/100];
number_features = size(x,2);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here $x$ is the data matrix containing all alternatives shown during the survey. Columns represent attributes.
The above code turns binary codings of price, MPG, acceleration, and range into real-valued ones,
so as to reduce the number of part-worths to estimate, assuming that consumers‚Äô preference change
linearly with respect to these attributes.</p>

<p>Accordingly, one will also need to change the following line (see the following explanation on random and fixed coefficients as well):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>NAMES = {'Price';'US';'European';'Asian';'MPG';'3 Stars';'4 Stars';'5 Stars';...
    '0-60 Acc';'Gasoline';'Hybrid';'EV';'Range'};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This line specifies the name tags for each part-worth. As you can see, for linear attributes, such as Price,
the tag is on the attribute itself, while for nonlinear ones, such as Make, we will need to specify
the levels as each one of them has a part-worth.</p>

<h3 id="create-a-mixed-logit-model">Create a mixed logit model</h3>
<p>Some other details can be fine-tuned.</p>

<p><strong>Random Coefficients</strong> are the subset of part-worths that you assume will be different for each participant.
The algorithm will provide a population-level estimate of these part-worths and also the individual-level ones.
This allows you to identify clusters of consumer groups and potentially design a product family for each group.
To set up random coefficients, change the following line:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>IDV = [3+(1:number_features)',ones(number_features,1)];
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here IDV is a matrix with 2 columns. The first is for part-worth IDs, while the second for their corresponding model distributions.
You can use ‚Äúnormal‚Äù if the coefficient can be either positive or negative (i.e., some people like it one way and others the opposite).
Or you can use ‚Äúlognormal‚Äù (or ‚Äútruncated normal‚Äù) if the coefficient should always be positive (e.g., people always prefer lower price, 
or equivalently, the coefficient on the negative price should always be positive).</p>

<p><strong>Fixed coefficients</strong> are shared part-worths across the population.</p>

<p><strong>Covariance</strong> of random coefficients can be enabled by the following line:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>FULLCV=1;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When set to 1, the algorithm will estimate the covariance matrix of the random coefficients, i.e., to figure out how one‚Äôs preference
on one attribute (or level) goes along with another. When set to 0, we assume that each random coefficient is drawn 
independently from their own distributions, i.e., the covariance matrix is diagonal.</p>

<h3 id="report-your-results">Report your results</h3>
<p>Once you finish running the algorithm, you will see a report in the console regarding the population-level part-worth estimates.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>                            Mean      StdDev     Share&lt;0    Share=0
