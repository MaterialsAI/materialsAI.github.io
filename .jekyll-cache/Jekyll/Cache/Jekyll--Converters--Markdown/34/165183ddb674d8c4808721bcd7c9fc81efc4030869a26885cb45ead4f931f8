<p>The following are potential topics you can pick or develop from.

<h3 id="topic-1-optimal-control-of-mirostructure-evolution">Topic 1. Optimal control of mirostructure evolution</h3>

<p><img src="/_images/desopt/kumar.png" alt="Drawing" style="height: 300px;" /></p>

<p>This project explores
answers to the following key questions: How does one optimally control
processing parameters to tailor advanced materials? And what are the
minimal requirements for processing that
facilitates the synthesis of a material with specific properties and
behavior? The research within this project will address these questions
by coupling phase-field method with optimal control theories for
determining optimal materials processing trajectories.</p>

<p>This project is a collaboration with Dr. Ankit Kumar.</p>

<p><strong>Key words</strong>: <strong>Optimal control</strong>, <strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></p>

<p>Effective and accurate characterization and quantification of complex
microstructure of a heterogeneous material and its evolution under
external stimuli are very challenging, yet crucial to achieving reliable
material performance prediction, processing optimization and advanced
material design. To address this challenge, hierarchical statistical
microstructural descriptors have been developed as potential
representations to facilitate data-driven material reconstruction
and prediction. However, there lacks a systematic way for identifying
the key descriptors from the infinite many choices
(see figure for example).</p>

<h3 id="topic-3-soft-gripper-defect-design">Topic 3. Soft gripper defect design</h3>

<p>Switchable adhesive materials have been developed as soft grippers for
lifting flat surfaces (such as microchips, glasses, solar panels, and
other products) of significantly larger dimensions with high energy efficiency, and have
potential in lowering manufacturing costs.</p>

<p>Importantly, the magnitude of the adhesive
force (i.e., the maximal pulling force) is tunable via external stimuli. For example,
when a voltage is applied, the percolating conductive propylene-based elastomer (cPBE)
phase carrying a current becomes softened due to joule heating, which leads to
re-distribution of stress concentration on the contact surface and thus, a decreased
maximal pulling force. An ideal gripper should possess a large pulling force without the stimuli
(to be able to pull up heavy objects) and a small pulling force with the stimuli
(to be able to drop light objects).</p>

<p>These pulling forces are influenced by both the material properties and defect patterns on
the interface. This project investigates the topological design of the interface defects
that governs the propagation of cracks under pulling, thus achieving high maximal pulling
force. Please see initial model development

<h3 id="topic-4-social-grace-in-self-driving">Topic 4. Social grace in self-driving</h3>

<p><img src="/_images/savi/nri_cover.png" alt="Drawing" style="height: 300px;" /></p>

<p>Self-driving cars are conservative
   in the way they drive. However, it is not clear whether their conservative behaviors
   are always seen as socially graceful. Let‚Äôs look at a specific counter-example: When being the leading car waiting for a left turn, the self-driving car may not understand the tacit
   rule that it should move itself forward a bit so that cars behind it can have a better
   chance to get through during their turn. Further, the self-driving car will not understand
   why cars behind it would honk when it does not move forward.</p>

<p>This project seeks answers to the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What is the formalism of motion planning to reproduce human-like behavior (moving forward
   a little bit in this case) when the self-driving car understands the intent of
   the car behind it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the formalism of learning to enable recognition of others‚Äô intents when
   the self-driving car receives a honk?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This project is collaboration with Dr. Yezhou Yang and Dr. Wenlong Zhang.</p>

<h3 id="topic-5-share-ride">Topic 5. Share ride</h3>

<p>Consider a city as a graph with finite number of nodes and edges. Each request is represented by
two different nodes for which a path between the two exists, one for pickup and the other for destination. 
Let a finite number of cars be at a subset of nodes. What is the best routing strategy to minimize the overall 
 distance to cover by these cars while meeting all requests?</p>
