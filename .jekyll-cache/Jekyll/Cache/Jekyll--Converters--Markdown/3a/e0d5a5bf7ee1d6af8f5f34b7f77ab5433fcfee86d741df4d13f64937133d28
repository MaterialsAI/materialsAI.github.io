<h3 id="executive-summary-"><strong>Executive Summary <a name="goal"></a></strong></h3>

<p>Through this project, we achieved the following goals and derived new research questions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Microstructure patterns can be learned and used to generate new material samples.</strong> 
Material microstructures are usually represented as high-resolution images and 
are limited in quantity due to high acquisition costs through experiments. We developed 
generative models that learn the latent dimensions of microstructures, and create 
new microstructure samples that are morphologically and statistically similar to 
the limited samples. The developed model allowed us to bootstrap limited material samples to improve 
predictive structure-property models. See details <a href="#prediction">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>While deep networks outperform conventional models, they are not yet capable of capturing 
 highly nonlinear structure-property mappings.</strong> The physics-based structure-property mapping often 
 involves high computational cost, 
due to nonlinear constitutive models of material systems. We validated the hypothesis
that deep learning architectures can outperform conventional nonlinear predictive models
(such as Support Vector Regression) in predicting structure-property mappings. However, we
 found that even state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks 
 cannot obtain the required prediction accuracy 
 for material microstructure optimization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Microstructure evolution of Ti64 during selective laser sintering is modeled and quantified.</strong> 
We developed a hybrid finite-element cellular-automaton model for microstructure evolution.
 This model is used for processing-structure mapping for Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64) alloy microstructures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An efficient lattice particle simulation is developed for Ti64 fractual strength computation.</strong>
A new atomic finite element method based on lattice particle is developed to
 replace an explicit solver to more efficiently compute Ti64 fracture strength. Nonlinear elasticity 
 and plasticity constitutive models will be added to further refine the lattice particle model.</p>
  </li>

<h3 id="results-and-findings-"><strong>Results and Findings <a name="results"></a></strong></h3>

<p>The results and findings are summarized as follows.</p>

<h4 id="generative-model-for-microstrutures-and-topologies-">Generative Model for Microstrutures and Topologies <a name="generative"></a></h4>
<p>While state-of-the-art generative models have achieved photo-realistic image generation 
based on often enormous amount of training samples, it is well understood that these models 
will fail to learn meaningful local patterns (poor distribution matching) when only a small 
amount of data (in the scale of ten to a hundred) is available. The latter is usually the 
case in material design due to the high acquisition cost of microstructure samples. 
Therefore applying existing generative models to microstructures yielded generations with 
morphological difference from the samples, making these models inapplicable to material 
systems where properties are sensitive to morphological details. The PIs have partially 
addressed this challenge using a layer-by-layer learning mechanism through Restricted 
Boltzmann Machines (see <strong>Fig 1a</strong>), yet this model requires extensive calibration of 
the model parameters (see <strong>Fig 1b</strong> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07401">the paper</a>), 
as it only preserves morphologies within 
each layers, thus has limited control over the output morphology through a multilayer network.</p>

<p><a class="caption"><strong>Figure 1.</strong> <strong>(a)</strong> Samples and generations of Ti64, Pb-Sn, Sandstone and spherical colloids through layer-by-layer

<strong>(b)</strong> The network requires material-dependent parameter tuning to reach good performance.
</a></p>

<p>To this end, we investigate solutions inspired by <em>style transfer</em> (ST), a method 
that quantifies the style of an image as the variance-covariance matrices of the 
hidden-layer activations (denoted as the <em>style vector</em>) of a convolutional neural 
network (CNN) when the image passes through it, and optimizes new images to match their 
style vectors to the target (see <strong>Fig 2a</strong> for ST on material images). Nonetheless, 
ST is not generative, since the generation of each new image requires an optimization 
directly in the image space. 
Our model combines ST with a generative model: In each iteration of the 
training, we pass both the generated images and the samples through a pre-trained CNN 
(a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556"><em>very deep network</em></a>) to calculate the discrepancy between their style vectors. 
This additional loss to be minimized regularizes the resultant generator to only generate 
images with styles consistent with the samples. It is worth noting that ST is also found 
to have better performance and less memory requirement than similar losses defined on 
correlation functions. <strong>Fig 2b</strong> compares the performance of generative models applied to 
several material systems with and without incorporating ST, with less than 100 samples in 
each case.</p>

<p><a class="caption"><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Generations through Style Transfer (ST), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN),
and the proposed VAE+ST method.</a></p>

<p>The findings are summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The layer-by-layer model (Convolutional Deep Belief Network) is effective at 
recovering microstructure details. Its parameters, however, require 
material-dependent tuning.</li>
  <li>The preliminary success with style transfer suggests that leveraging additional 
information in network training leads to better generations. This inspires the 
current investigation: Extending the idea of style transfer, we propose to 
regularize the generation through a physically meaningful loss. The loss will 
be calculated by measuring how well the generated microstructure matches the 
equilibrium state governed by the processing parameters.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="structure-property-prediction-">Structure-Property Prediction <a name="prediction"></a></h4>
<p>We investigated the utility of deep neural networks when applied to predict structure-property
mappings. Two specific mappings are studied: The fracture strength of Ti64, and the 
Young’s modulus of sandstone. The fracture strength is computed by an explicit solver
on a particle model of the Ti64 microstructure (see [the development of the model][Ti64model]).
The Young’s modulus is computed via a Strong Contrast Expansion method, which expresses 
the elastic properties of a heterogeneous material in terms of individual phase properties 
and microstructural parameters involving the integration of correlation functions. 
Our findings are as follows.</p>

<p>In the sandstone case, we used 40 images for training an initial residual network. 
We then used the developed generative model to create an additional 400 sandstone samples around those that
have large prediction errors. 
The enriched dataset then leads to an improved predictive model as shown in <strong>Fig. 3a</strong>. 
To understand whether the network learns the correlation between structural patterns and 
the property, we scan a material 
sample and convert each small material patch to the void phase and evaluate the changes in Young’s modulus. 
We then compare the true changes with those derived from the prediction. Result shows that the improved model
has better understanding of the local structure-property correlation, although there
is still room for improvements (<strong>Fig. 3b</strong>).</p>

<p><a class="caption"><strong>Figure 3.</strong> <strong>(a)</strong> Comparison on the prediction performance of a residual network trained with 40 sandstone samples (blue)
and with the additional 400 samples generated using the proposed VAE+ST model (red).
<strong>(b)</strong> Sensitivity analysis of local structural patterns.</a></p>

<p>In the Ti64 case, we encountered difficulty in reaching plausible predictive performance 
for fracture strength, with extensive testing of network architectures. We should, however,
note that the residual network still outperforms a standard benchmark 
(Support Vector Regression) with 1000 microstructure samples. This is because the 
residual network exploits the flexibility of an arbitrarily deep network while preventing 
the issue with local network convergence (which often causes poor prediction performance). 
It does so by shrinking a network layer to identity when the layer does not offer additional performance advantage.
See <strong>Fig. 4</strong>.</p>

<p><a class="caption"><strong>Figure 4.</strong> Comparison on the prediction performance of a Support Vector Regression model (yellow),
a VGG model (blue), and a residual network model (red).</a></p>

<p>The findings are summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The generative model developed through this project can be used to enrich a small material dataset
to improve the prediction performance of a resulting surrogate model.</li>
  <li>Deep networks achieve better performance in capturing structure-property mappings
than standard surrogate models.</li>
  <li>Nonetheless, deep networks fail to predict highly-nonlinear mappings. 
<strong>This suggests that the incorporation of physics-based knowledge into the surrogate model
is necessary.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="modeling-and-quantification-of-microstructure-evolution-of-ti-6al-4v-during-selective-laser-sintering-sls-">Modeling and quantification of microstructure evolution of Ti-6Al-4V during selective laser sintering (SLS) <a name="evolution"></a></h4>
<p>A hybrid finite-element cellular-automaton model for microstructure evolution in Ti64 during 
SLS has been 
developed and calibrated. The model incorporates the nonlinear variation of 
intrinsic material properties (i.e., specific heat, heat conductivity and material 
density) during SLS as well as temperature- and property-dependent heterogeneous 
nucleation and growth dynamics. It has been employed to investigate Ti64 microstructures 
associated with different processing conditions (laser power density, spot moving
 speed, etc). The alloy microstructures are subsequently quantified via spatial
  correlation functions to derive quantitative processing-structure relations.</p>

<h4 id="efficient-lattice-particle-simulation-algorithms">Efficient lattice particle simulation algorithms</h4>
<p>The commonly used explicit dynamic solution algorithm for lattice particle method is time consuming, 
especially for large scale simulations (e.g., many grains within 3D microstructure). 
A new atomic finite element method for the proposed lattice particle method is developed to address 
this issue. First, the energy minimization principle in AFEM will be applied to the developed 
non-local lattice formulation at the equilibrium condition during the quasi-static loading steps. 
The non-local stiffness matrix of elements will be constructed using the similar format in classical 
FEM. Connectivity in the non-local finite elements will be explored with respect to different 
crystal microstructures. Following this, the concurrent coupling between classical FEM and the 
lattice particle method will be developed. The concurrent coupling is achieved by a “faded layer” 
between the AFEM and FEM domain, where the non-locality gradually reduces from the AFEM domain to 
the FEM domain. Thus, a smooth transition between the non-local lattice method and FEM can be 
achieved without numerical artifacts at the boundaries (see <strong>Fig. 6(a)</strong> for a 2D example). 
Model verification will be performed for several benchmark problems (<strong>Fig. 6(b)</strong>). 
Significant improvement in computational efficiency is observed for the proposed atomic finite element 
formulation (<strong>Fig. 6(c)</strong>).</p>
