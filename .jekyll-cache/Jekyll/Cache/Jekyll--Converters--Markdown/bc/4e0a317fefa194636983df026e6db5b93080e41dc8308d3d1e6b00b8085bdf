<h3 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h3>

<p>In this class you will learn to use advanced analytical tools to guide your design decisions. 
It has three main emphases: (1) design as an optimization process (design of experiments, sensitivity analysis,
response surface, optimization), (2) consumer preference modeling (conjoint analysis, discrete choice analysis,
Hierarchical Bayes modeling), and (3) 
Internet of things (Arduino ESP8266 programming). We will also talk about new material design, business modeling, 
and also how to launch a product on crowdfunding platforms. You are expected to solve a real-world problem with your 
design solution, and propose a business plan for your product.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="workload-and-grading">Workload and grading</h3>

<p>This class will be <strong>time-consuming</strong>. There are <strong>3 homework assignments</strong>, <strong>3 presentations</strong>, and <strong>3 reports</strong>. We will also
host two in-class design competitions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Homework (10%*3)</li>
  <li>Final report (50%)</li>
  <li>Design competition (10%*2)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="project">Project</h3>

<p>Students are expected to demonstrate the alpha-, beta-, and the final design at the three presentations, respectively.
The final product needs to be functional. There will be three project reports along with the presentations. Reports are 
not standalone, but are meant to represent the continuous development of the project. Please read report and presentation 
[guidelines][report].</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="design-competitions">Design competitions</h3>

<p>Competitions are mini challenges that test studentsâ€™ ability at applying knowledge learned from the class to real design
problems. Students are expected to prepare designs off the class along the completion of the homework (HW1 and HW3).</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="laboratory-facilities">Laboratory Facilities</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each team will be given the baseline microchips for IoT functionalities. Various sensors (see [list here][sensor]) are 
available for testing upon request to the instructor. Teams will purchase <strong>on their own</strong> all other materials needed for
their project.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teams will have free access to the TechShop (contact: Info.ch@techshop.com) for prototyping, and to Qualtrics for consumer surveys.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="issue-with-intellectual-property">Issue with Intellectual Property</h3>

<p>The IP you develop and present during the class are NOT protected in theory. However, please note that
for your product to be successful in the market, it would take much more than what you will develop
during the class. ASU provides various services for student startups, see <a href="https://engineering.asu.edu/startup-center/venture-devils/">Venture Devils</a> for 
product development and the <a href="https://www.law.asu.edu/experiences/clinics/iap">Innovation Advancement Program</a> for legal support. For complete information,

<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>Each student has an obligation to act with honesty and integrity, and to respect the rights of others in carrying out all academic assignments. MAE 540 will follow the process defined by the Office of the Dean of Students, which states that any student who is found to have violated the Student Code of Conduct will, at a minimum, receive an E in the course. The College Policy defines the process to be used if the student wishes to appeal this action.</p>
