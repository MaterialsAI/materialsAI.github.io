<h2 id="activity-1-introduce-the-problems-your-want-to-address">Activity 1: Introduce the problems your want to address</h2>
<p>As we have started thinking about real-world problems that could be addressed in this project, 
it is a good time to share our ideas and collect feedback from others.</p>

<p>For the team who presents the problem and potential solutions, please provide the following information</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the problem?</li>
  <li>How is it done today?</li>
  <li>What’s new in your solution?</li>
  <li>Who cares?</li>
  <li>What are the risks of your solution?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also see <a href="http://www.design.caltech.edu/erik/Misc/Heilmeier_Questions.html">The Heilmeier Catechism</a>.</p>

<p>For other teams, please criticize from the following perspectives:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did the proposer miss existing solutions?</li>
  <li>Do people really care about this problem?</li>
  <li>Who will pay for the solution?</li>
  <li>What are the risks of this solution?</li>
</ul>

<p>Also watch Tony Fadell’s TED talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uOMectkCCs"><em>The first secret of great design</em></a></p>

<h2 id="activity-2-create-a-persona">Activity 2: Create a persona</h2>
<p>A <strong>Persona</strong> is a description of a character that the product will be designed for. 
A Persona represents:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Personal Profile</strong>, e.g., age, gender, education, habits, social status, marital status, occupation, hobbies, et.</li>
  <li><strong>Role</strong>, e.g., position at work, role at work, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Context</strong>, e.g., social and cultural background, peers, family status</li>
</ul>

<p>What is the persona of your users?</p>

<h2 id="activity-3-think-out-of-the-box">Activity 3: Think out of the box</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Double check your assumptions: You have nine dots. Draw <strong>four</strong> continuous straight lines passing through each of the nine dots, but DO NOT pass
                                                   a dot twice, retrace a line, or lift your pen.

  </li>
  <li>Let’s try another problem: You are one of five people in a locked room with a concrete 
floor. There is a steel tube embedded in the floor. A ping-pong ball is inside the tube. 
Get the ball out of the tube in the most efficient manner.

You have:
    <ul>
      <li>a chisel</li>
      <li>a box of cornflakes</li>
      <li>a hammer</li>
      <li>a file</li>
      <li>a wire coat hanger</li>
      <li>a light bulb</li>
      <li>100ft of clothesline</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Team brainstorming:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>List potential solutions to your problems</li>
  <li>Discuss what assumptions you imposed on the solutions</li>
  <li>Discuss if these assumptions can be removed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="activity-4-morphological-analysis">Activity 4: Morphological analysis</h2>

<p>Now let’s think about how your solution can be realized through a product. 
Practice the following using your problems</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify all functions of your solution</li>
  <li>Make each function a row in a matrix</li>
  <li>Identify all possible means to realize each function, and list in columns</li>
  <li>Create solutions by combining different means and drawing the concept</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="activity-5-optimal-design-and-optimal-control">Activity 5: Optimal design and optimal control</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Learn the concept of <strong>objective</strong>, <strong>attribute</strong>, <strong>variable</strong>, <strong>constraint</strong> in a static setting</li>
  <li>Learn the concept of <strong>state</strong>, <strong>action</strong>, <strong>reward</strong>, <strong>controller</strong> in a dynamic setting</li>
  <li>Is finding solutions to a static design problem a dynamic process?</li>
  <li>Team discussion: What are your design objectives, variables, attributes, constraints, and assumptions?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="activity-6-critical-thinking">Activity 6: Critical thinking</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Design a cola can</li>
  <li>Find the curve of fastest descent (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachistochrone_curve">Brachistochrone curve</a> and <a href="http://www.osaka-ue.ac.jp/zemi/nishiyama/math2010/cycloid.pdf">its derivation</a>)</li>
  <li>Design a bridge (see <a href="http://www.topopt.dtu.dk/?q=node/751">TopOpt</a>)</li>
  <li>Four-bar linkage design (see <a href="http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/motiongen/download.html">MotionGen</a>)</li>
  <li>Optimal design + control (see <a href="http://ecoracer.herokuapp.com/">ecoRacer game</a>)</li>
