<h1 id="a-tutorial-on-curve-fitting">A Tutorial on Curve Fitting</h1>

<p>As you have seen through the class, curve fitting happens all the time through the 
development of engineering knowledge, due to the fact that we often have the ability to observe things
before we understand them. Thus curve fitting almost always indicate a sub-optimal solution due to 
the lack of more rigorous methodology or time. But since engineering design is so complicated, 
it becomes a regular part of engineers‚Äô thinking.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will first go through the very basic techniques of curve fitting, which you may have 
already learned through Excel or Matlab. I will then talk about more broadly the issue of curve fitting.
The purpose is for you to understand that when people talk about machine learning and AI, they are often
talking about ‚Äúcurve fitting‚Äù.</p>

<p>You may also want to check 
<a href="http://designinformaticslab.github.io/_teaching/designopt/metamodeling.pdf">my slides on this topic</a> and
the enormous amount of tutorials online. The fancy keywords are ‚Äúregression‚Äù, ‚Äúsupervised learning‚Äù, 
‚Äúmeta-modeling‚Äù.</p>

<h2 id="lets-define-curve-fitting">Let‚Äôs define ‚Äúcurve fitting‚Äù</h2>
<p>Curve fitting, or formally <strong>supervised learning</strong>, deals with <strong>labeled</strong> data 
\(\mathcal{D} = [{\bf x}_1,{\bf y}_1,{\bf x}_2,{\bf y}_2,\cdots]\) 
where \({\bf x}\) is the input and \({\bf y}\) the output (or the label). For example, the inputs can be Trump‚Äôs tweets
and the outputs the stock market performance right after that; or the inputs material microstructures 
and the outputs their fracture strength; or the inputs camera images and 
the outputs recognitions of objects within the images; or the inputs 
graphical representations of chemical compounds and the outputs the survival rate of test specimens; 
or ‚Ä¶this can go on forever.</p>

<p>In its simplest setting, supervised learning deals with scalar or 
vectorial inputs and scalar outputs. The goal is to fit a curve (for 1D input) or a surface 
(for 2D input) or a hypersurface (for nD input) to the data so that when a new input is given, 
we can find an accurate prediction of the corresponding output from the curve or surface or 
hypersurface. Often the question is: Do I use a straight line to fit or some kind of curve? How do I decide?
An important concept to learn here is the <strong>Occam‚Äôs razor</strong>. To put this into context,
<strong>the prediction accuracy of your curve goes up when the curve fit well with the data, 
but also goes down if your curve is too wavy</strong>. In other words, you want to find a curve 
(e.g., a polynomial function of a certain degree) that fits through most of the data points 
(no under-fitting) but do not overfit.
Common approaches to this include information criteria (check <em>AIC</em> and <em>BIC</em>) and <em>cross-validation</em>.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-do-curve-fitting-in-matlab">How do you do curve fitting in Matlab?</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs now talk about how to actually do curve fitting without going deeper into the theory.
<!--For sampled data, a n-th order polynomial can be used to describe data points for missing -->
<!--indepedent axis data.  --></p>

<h3 id="curve-fitting-with-scalar-input">Curve fitting with scalar input</h3>
<p>In Matlab, this can be done using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polyfit()</code> function when the input is scalar. 
Required inputs are the sampled input and output data, and the degree of the desired polynomial. 
The output is a \(n+1\) length vector describing the polynomial coefficients where \(n\) is 
the degree of the polynomial.</p>

<!--The degree of the polynomial is important to most accuurately describe the trend in data -->
<!--(less error is not always beneficial).-->
<!--Over-fitting can result in less-accurate data during extrapolation and interpolation although -->
<!--the error between data points will appear to be less.-->

<p>After finding the polynomial coefficients, its easiest to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">polyval()</code> 
function to evaluate the polynomial at the desired \({\bf x}\) values.  This can be more 
explicitly represented as:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y = p(1).*x.^n + p(2).*x.^(n-1) + ... + p(n).*x + p(n+1)</code>.</p>

<p>An example in use is below along with visualization of over-fitting and under-fitting:</p>

<h3 id="curve-fitting-with-vectorial-input">Curve fitting with vectorial input</h3>
<p>Often times your inputs are vectors (e.g., images, structures, texts, audios, etc.). 
<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/curvefitting.html">The Matlab curve fitting toolbox</a> 
has a whole bunch of tools for fitting vectorial inputs to scalar (or vectorial) outputs. 
If the toolbox is not free to you, I highly recommend <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">sk-learn</a>
as a free and better alternative. Sk-learn is very well documented and has plenty of examples for 
you to follow.</p>

<p>Without going too much into the software details, I want to summarize a few important 
categories of curve fitting models that are often used in engineering, with their pros and cons. 
You will need to find their implementations either from Matlab, or sk-learn, or other places.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Linear models: These are the most widely used and are often very effective. Note that <em>linear</em> 
here does not mean that the model can only fit straight lines. In fact, this category includes all 
polynomial curves and beyond (as long as the model is linear in the parameter space). 
<strong>Pros</strong>: Easy to use. Implementation can be found everywhere (start with Matlab).
<strong>Cons</strong>: Don‚Äôt work well when the data is too wavy. You will need to define how the curve look like 
(e.g., the degree of a polynomial function).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Kernel machines: A typical kernel machine is the <em>Support Vector Machine</em> (SVM). I will skip the 
 technical details since SVM has been a standard and you can find tutorials on it easily. 
 To summarize, SVM with nonlinear kernel is non-parametric, meaning that they can 
 fit through all data points using the smoothest curve if needed and can 
 automatically prevent overfitting through hyperparameter tuning. Yes, that‚Äôs a lot, but everything
is automated in standard SVM packages, e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libSVM</code> (also included in sk-learn) and Matlab‚Äôs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fitrsvm</code>. 
<strong>Pros</strong>: Very flexible. Can handle complicated input-output relations and high-dimensional inputs.
<strong>Cons</strong>: Curve fitting takes longer 
(in general scales with the square of the number of data points) and takes more storage space. 
Model not interpretable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gaussian process: Similar to SVM with nonlinear kernel, GPs are non-parametric and can 
fit through all data points perfectly. Thus GP is commonly used to fit simulation data 
(where no measurement noise is assumed). 
<strong>Pros</strong>: Very flexible. Can handle complicated input-output relations. 
The model naturally provides uncertainty of the prediction.
<strong>Cons</strong>: Curve fitting takes longer (in general scales with the square of the number of data points)
and takes more storage space. Accuracy of the model is sensitive to hyperparameter tuning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Neural network: This is probably the most popular tool for curve fitting with all the successful 
applications of <em>deep learning</em>. Unlike kernal machines and Gaussian process though, 
we still don‚Äôt have much theory developed to guide the construction of neural networks, and 
we only know they work when they actually work! 
<strong>Pros</strong>: Somehow, they often work when you have a lot of data and know all the tricks 
in training them. <strong>Cons</strong>: Even when you believe they work, you don‚Äôt know when they don‚Äôt.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="from-curve-fitting-to-real-engineering-challenges">From curve fitting to real engineering challenges</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why curve fitting is a good idea for solving engineering problems 
(while not necessarily the best idea). I will summarize with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Accelerate computation: We have shifted most of the engineering practices from experiments 
to simulations to speed up the design and validation processes. However, engineering simulations 
are still very slow, especially when dealing with complex systems and when fidelity matters. 
For example, vehicle crash, material fatigue, and CFD simulations still takes hours on 
high-performance computers. Curve fitting can potentially accelerate such simulations, i.e., we can 
 build predictive models based on previous simulation data to circumvent future call of 
 expensive simulations. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOWamCtnwTc">this video</a> on 
 an accelerated Navier-Stokes solver for example. The same technique can be applied to accelerate 
 a large range of engineering simulations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accelerated design: One benefit of accelerating simulations is that now we can evaluate 
(and thus optimize) new engineering designs faster. See for example the following process 
where we optimize a material microstructure towards higher or lower Young‚Äôs modulus based 
on a ‚Äúcurve‚Äù that predicts the modulus based on the microstructure.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-difficult">What‚Äôs difficult?</h2>
<p>I will end with a brief discussion on what is currently wrong with curve fitting, 
and particularly their applications to engineering domains. Overall, as we move from 
scenarios with simple data and simple models (e.g., linear models and kernel machines) to those with 
high-dimensional data and complex models (e.g., neural networks), we loose the capability 
to tell when things will go wrong. In fact, things are going wrong. For example, we now know that
vision systems on autonomous cars can be 
<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e373/d6275ec975c9c74e35348486d9b262b3ecbd.pdf">attacked</a> 
to recognize stop signs as speed limit signs (search <em>adversial attack</em> to see most recent 
developments in this direction). One can imaging that when we use complex ‚Äúcurves‚Äù to fit 
engineering data, things can also go wrong, i.e., an engineering design optimized by a 
machine based on a predictive model can be totally crap. The <strong>key issue</strong> 
is that <strong>our current knowledge about curve fitting does not lead to knowledge transfer of a machine</strong>,
i.e., a machine cannot do extrapolation or even interpolation well with the data presented. 
See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEhw5t6rhc">lecture</a> from Yann Lecun on 
this broadly existing issue.</p>
