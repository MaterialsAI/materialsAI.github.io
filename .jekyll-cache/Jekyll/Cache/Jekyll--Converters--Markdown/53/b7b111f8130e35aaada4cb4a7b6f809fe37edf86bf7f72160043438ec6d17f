<p>by Max Yi Ren</p>

<p>See the <a href="/_teaching/productdesign/AnalyticalDesign.pptx">lecture notes</a> and the <a href="http://designinformaticslab.github.io/productdesign_tutorial/2016/11/20/ansys.html">Ansys tutorial</a>.</p>

<h2 id="activity-1-doe-and-response-surface-methods">Activity 1: DOE and response surface methods</h2>
<p>Based on the structural analysis settings in the Ansys tutorial, conduct DOE and create a response
surface. Discuss which DOE method and response surface model you should use.</p>

<h2 id="homework-3-design-analysis">Homework 3: Design Analysis</h2>
<p>Create the necessary simulation for your project, and perform optimization on 
your product attributes with respect to the design variables. Note: If your project
does not involve physical design, please use the braking disk example in the tutorial.</p>

<p>The report should contain the following elements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>An executive summary of your model, the objectives, 
constraints, variables, and design results (One page).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A description of your geometry, material assignment, mesh settings, and boundary conditions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A discussion on whether your simulation results are reasonable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A description of the analysis: DOE, response surface, sensitivity analysis
    <ul>
      <li>How do you choose your DOE method?</li>
      <li>How do you choose your response surface model?</li>
      <li>How good is your response surface model?</li>
      <li>Are your objectives sensitive to the chosen variables?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A description of the optimization and results
    <ul>
      <li>What optimization algorithm do you use?</li>
      <li>What improvements do you get from the optimization?</li>
      <li>Is your optimal solution reasonable?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Please do not paste a large amount of images directly from ANSYS. You need to edit
figures so that they contain just the necessary information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your report to yiren@asu.edu with the exact title “MAE540 Homework 3 - Team number”. 
Please make sure it is in <strong>pdf</strong> format.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
