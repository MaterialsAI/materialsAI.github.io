<h1 id="design-competition-2-results---spring-2017">Design Competition 2 Results - Spring 2017</h1>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Here are some statistics. 36% of the submissions are on time (before 6:40pm), 52% of 
all are feasible, i.e., within the mass limit (25000 Kg). Among all feasible designs, the 
minimal max deformation achieved is 5.79e-6 Meter (updated Apr. 19, 2017), with mass 17939 Kg.</p>

<p>The average grade is 79.7, with std 8.4. Highest grade is 100.</p>

<h2 id="grading-rules">Grading rules</h2>
<p>Let $d_1$ and $d_2$ be the maximal and minimal max deformation values for all designs that are 
submitted in time, and $d$ be your value. The grade is
 \(20\left(1-\frac{d-d_2}{d_1-d_2}\right)+80\).</p>

<p>The penalty for late submission is 10 points. The penalty for violating the mass constraint
is 5, 10, 20 points for mass within 4 times of the limit, within 10 times of the limit, and beyond.
I also adjust your grades manually to make the competition ‚Äúfair‚Äù. For example, if you have 
a huge mass and thus the lowest deformation, then according to the above formula, you might still
get a good score because your deformation value is so much better than that of the best 
feasible design.</p>

<p>Regarding the concern that delaying the submission may lead to better grade, the average grade
for in-time submissions is 87.1, while that for late submissions is 75.4. 96% (33%) of in-time 
(late) submissions have grades above 80.</p>
