<h3 id="problem-1-10-points">Problem 1 (10 Points)</h3>

<p>A pivot in a linkage has a pin in the figure whose dimension \(a \pm t_a\) is to be established. The
  thickness of the link clevis is \(1.500 \pm 0.005\) in. The designer has concluded that a gap of between
  0.004 and 0.05 in will satisfactorily sustain the function of the linkage pivot. Determine the
  dimension \(a\) and its tolerance.</p>

<h3 id="problem-2-10-points">Problem 2 (10 Points)</h3>

<p>For the plane stress \(\sigma_x\) = -8MPa, \(\sigma_y\) = 7MPa, \(\tau_{xy}\) = 6MPa cw, 
    draw a Mohr’s circle diagram properly labeled,
   find the principal normal and shear stresses, and determine the angle from the \(x\) axis to 
   \(\sigma_1\). Draw stress elements as in Fig. 3-11c and d (Shigley’s) and label all details.</p>

<h3 id="problem-3-20-points">Problem 3 (20 Points)</h3>

<p>A countershaft carrying two V-belt pulleys is shown in the figure. Pulley A receives power from a
   motor through a belt with the belt tensions shown. The power is transmitted through the shaft and
   delivered to the belt on pulley B. Assume the belt tension on the loose side at B is 15 percent of
   the tension on the tight side.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Determine the tensions in the belt on pulley B, assuming the shaft is running at a constant
   speed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find the magnitudes of the bearing reaction forces, assuming the bearings act as simple
   supports.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Draw shear-force and bending-moment diagrams for the shaft. If needed, make one set for the
   horizontal plane and another set for the vertical plane.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the point of maximum bending moment, determine the bending stress and the torsional
   shear stress.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At the point of maximum bending moment, determine the principal stresses and the maximum
   shear stress.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-4-20-points">Problem 4 (20 Points)</h3>

<p>The cantilevered bar in the figure is made from a ductile material and is statically loaded with
   \(F_y = 200\) lbf and \(F_x = F_z = 0\). Analyze the stress situation in rod AB by obtaining the following
   information.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Determine the precise location of the critical stress element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sketch the critical stress element and determine magnitudes and directions for all stresses acting
   on it. (Transverse shear may only be neglected if you can justify this decision.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For the critical stress element, determine the principal stresses and the maximum shear stress.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="problem-5-40-points">Problem 5 (40 Points)</h3>

<p>Consider a cantilever beam as shown in the figure with length \(l\) and the left end fixed to a wall.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Derive the deflection \(y\) of the beam along \(x\) under a single downward force \(F\) on the right,
and assume that the moment of inertia \(I\) is constant along \(x\). 
(Show complete derivation instead of the final function \(y(x)\))</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now consider that the beam has two connected parts, with the part on the left (of length \(l/2\)) having a moment of 
inertia \(I_1\), and the part on the right \(I_2\). Derive the deflection \(y\) again. Ignore stress concentration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Further, consider that the cross-sections for the two parts are both circular, and the total volume
of the beam is constant. What should \(I_1\) and \(I_2\) be for the beam to have minimal maximum deflection?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Can you extend your conclusion in 3 to a beam with three evenly segmented parts with different moment of inertia?</p>
  </li>
</ol>
